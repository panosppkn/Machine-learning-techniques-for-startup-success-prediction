# Machine-learning-techniques-for-startup-success-prediction

This is the code for my thesis project to graduate from Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA.

Summarize the project:
1. Explore the dataset and visualizations
2. Choose and transform features in order to create useful datasets
3. Use ML models (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests, KNNs, SVM) to predict success (M&A or IPO) of the companies (binary classification)
